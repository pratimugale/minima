My project aims to provide an API for different programming languages to load/unload firmware and communicate with the PRUs from User Space. A GUI application that runs on the terminal will also be provided for debugging the PRUs step by step.

The mentors for the project are:
Kumar Abhishek
Zubeen Tolani (ZeekHuge) and
Patryk Mężydło
