Why is PWM on PRU is beneficial? 
There is hardware PWM support available on the BBB
that can be accessed directly from Linux user space. However, sysfs is slow
at adjusting the duty cycle, and it is prone to the same type of nonpreemptive latency issues as regular GPIOs.
PWM has many applications, such as motor and lighting control, and the PRU can provide a very high frequency PWM.
As a second example, we can use PWM for precise control of servo/stepper motors.
I also plan to use PWM with PRU to output a sine wave signal, by rapidly changing the duty cycle of a high‚Äêfrequency switched digital output cyclically as a function of time. For this, we can use the C-program to use mathematical functions to generate sine values which can be written into the PRU SRAM/DRAM. The PRU ASSEMBLY PROGRAM will read these duty cycle values from the memory and produce the output on the reuired GPIO pin.
