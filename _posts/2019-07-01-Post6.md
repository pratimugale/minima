Why is PWM on PRU is beneficial? 
There is hardware PWM support available on the BBB
that can be accessed directly from Linux user space. However, sysfs is slow
at adjusting the duty cycle, and it is prone to the same type of nonpreemptive latency issues as regular GPIOs.
PWM has many applications, such as motor and lighting control, and the PRU can provide a very high frequency PWM.
As a second example, we can use PWM for precise control of servo/stepper motors.
I also plan to use PWM with PRU to output a sine wave signal, by rapidly changing the duty cycle of a high‚Äêfrequency switched digital output cyclically as a function of time. For this, we can use the C-program to use mathematical functions to generate sine values which can be written into the PRU SRAM/DRAM. The PRU ASSEMBLY PROGRAM will read these duty cycle values from the memory and produce the output on the reuired GPIO pin.

After spending the weekend reading different PRU projects and trying different PWM variations, I have come up with a good example that gives a pretty accurate result. The `single-step` mode still gives some wierd results and I'm exploring the reason behind this. If I have to adjust the frequency of PWM, I will need more than 1 byte of data to store the duty cycle. After doing some math, I have come up with this: To set the PWM frequency from 1MHz to 1 Hz, I will need 4 bytes maximum to store the total PWM cycles. (For 1MHz, 200 cycles ((100 value) are needed; so for 1Hz, 200,000,000 total cycles will be needed). So, memory location 0x00010000 to 0x00010003 will store (ON cycles)/2) and 0x00010005 to 0x00010008 will store ((maximum cycles)/2).<br>

For doing this, I will have to modify the mem_read(), mem_write() functions to handling 4 bytes of data at a time. Though this is a slow process of transferring data, it is helpful for experimenting and one time data transfer.

**One important thing that I realized today is that the instruction `LBBO &R1, R10, 0, 4` stores the byte-wise data BACKWARDS into the register R1** It took me a while to realize this after getting some very wierd results.(The frequency of PWM became extremely low). <br>
So, what happens is: Suppose<br>
(0x00010000) -> 0xA5 <br>
(0x00010001) -> 0x31 <br>
(0x00010002) -> 0x54 <br>
(0x00010003) -> 0xFF <br>
Now if we do `LDI R10, 0x00010000` and `LBBO &R1, R10, 0, 4`. LBBO will copy 4 bytes of data into R1.<br>
But the value of R1 will be -> FF5431A5 and **NOT** A53154FF.
