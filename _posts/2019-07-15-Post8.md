Where I was stuck: 
1. I was creating the PRUSS object inside the activate_motor() function. Instead I now add the PRUSS and PRU p0,p1 objects as members of the Driver class in the header file itself.
2. One more error/problem I'm facing is that when activate_motor() function is called twice, the second call disrupts the working of the first function call. Noticed that the disruption is also not consistent, might be because of the Linux scheduling or something.
