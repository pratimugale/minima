## Aim: 
Instead of using /dev/mem, I was thinking of using a generalized driver as written in PRU-DMA project and then creating a sysfs interface to read/write from memory. Then I can add the memory functions to the python daemon service.<br>

-------
<br>
The first example I'm going to start with is the PWM example. The inputs can be written to the shared memory via the sysfs entries for the dma driver. Then the PRUs can read the shared memory and change the ouput accordingly.<br>

So I'll have to get the PRU DMA project up and running. This seems like a little difficult task for me as I've not understood how the project exactly works. I'll track all my progress regarding DMA here.<br>

* Clone the Project - [README](https://github.com/maciejjo/beaglebone-pru-dma/blob/master/Documentation/README.md)
* `export PRU_CGT=/usr/share/ti/cgt-pru`
* `wget https://git.ti.com/pru-software-support-package/pru-software-support-package/archive-tarball/v5.1.0` - He gives this step. However I used my pru-software-support-package. `export PRU_SSP=~/pru-software-support-package`(Path to pru-software-support-package).
* To use PRU DMA, PRU software package must be patched with a patch supplied in pru_dma repository. To apply it go to PRU_SSP directory and issue following: `$ patch -p1 < ${PATH_TO_PRU_DMA_REPO}/pru-swpkg-patch/0001-Add-PRU-DMA-custom-resource-to-resource-table.patch`
<!-- For me: $ patch -p1 < ~/work/beaglebone-pru-dma/pru-swpkg-patch/0001-Add-PRU-DMA-custom-resource-to-resource-table.patch -->
* Then, go to `/firmware/lib/pru_dma_lib` directory and build the library by issuing 'make' command. After successful build, library can be used in PRU applications.
### Set-up on PRU Firmware side is now done

### Set-up on kernel module side - patching kernel: 
* Followed his instructions, but got error for current kernel while installing the patch.
* So I changed the branch to 4.9.36-ti-r46
* No errors but warnings come up (squelched whitespace errors)
* Then running `./build_deb.sh` gives Failed dependency check error.<br> Do `sudo apt-get update` & `sudo apt-get install fakeroot lsb-release man-db gettext`<br>
* Run `./build_deb.sh` again.

## About the PRU Memory Region
--------
The PRU-ICSS comprises various distinct addressable regions that are mapped to both a local and global memory map. 
The local memory maps are maps with respect to the PRU core point of view. 
The global memory maps are maps with respect to the Host point of view, but can also be accessed by the PRUICSS.

i.e. local is with respect to PRU0, PRU1 individually; global is w.r.t the entire PRU SubSystem 

### Local Instruction Memory Map
Each PRU core has a dedicated 8KB of Instruction Memory which needs to be initialized by a Host processor before the PRU executes instructions. 
This region is only accessible to masters via the interface/ OCP slave port when the PRU is not running.

| Start Address | PRU0 | PRU1 |
|---------------|------|------|
| 0x0000_0000 | 8KB IRAM | 8KB IRAM |
