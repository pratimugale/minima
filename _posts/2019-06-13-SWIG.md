SWIG is an interface compiler that connects programs written in C and C++ with scripting languages. It works by taking the declarations found in C/C++ header files and using them to generate the wrapper code that scripting languages need to access the underlying C/C++ code. <br>

Download SWIG from [their site](http://www.swig.org/download.html) and follow steps given [here](https://www.dev2qa.com/how-to-install-swig-on-macos-linux-and-windows/) to complete installation. <br>
