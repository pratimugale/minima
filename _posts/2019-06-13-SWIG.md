SWIG is an interface compiler that connects programs written in C and C++ with scripting languages. It works by taking the declarations found in C/C++ header files and using them to generate the wrapper code that scripting languages need to access the underlying C/C++ code. <br>

Download SWIG from [their site](http://www.swig.org/download.html) and follow steps given [here](https://www.dev2qa.com/how-to-install-swig-on-macos-linux-and-windows/) to complete installation. <br>

First I'll be testing on python

“wrapper” functions are needed to access C/C++ which serve as a glue layer between languages.

After writing the .c and .h files for the C library, do this: 

1. `$ swig -python example.i`

2. ` $ gcc -c example.c example_wrap.c \` <br>
   `/usr/bin/python2.7`<br>
   This is because the python2.7 file is found in /usr/bin/ on the BeagleBone Black Debian

3. On step #2, you might encounter this error:
```
fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
 # include <Python.h>
                     ^
compilation terminated.
```
Following might be possible causes –

You might not have ‘Python.h’ file or
You are providing wrong location of ‘Python.h’ file to compiler

To get ‘Python.h’ You must install Python-dev using following command – <br>

`$ sudo apt-get install python-dev`<br>
Most probably this will already be installed on the BBB.<br>

To find the correct path of ‘Python.h’ execute following command –<br>
`$ python-config --cflags`<br>
The output will be something like this - 

_**-I/usr/include/python2.7** -I/usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf/python2.7  -fno-strict-aliasing -Wdate-time -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -g -fdebug-prefix-map=/build/python2.7-EEvVvy/python2.7-2.7.13=. -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security  -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O2 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes_
