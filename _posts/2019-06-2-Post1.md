## Accomplishments
1. Created the API in C and added functions - libraries/cpruss.c in the repository.
2. Project Repository: [https://github.com/pratimugale/pruss-api](https://github.com/pratimugale/pruss-api)
3. Added the Blinky Program from PRU CookBook and tested with the API for both PRUs.
4. Added Installation scripts and its Documentation.
5. Made a script that will modify .bashrc for shortened terminal commands for starting and stopping the PRUs (There is an issue for restarting).
6. Studied more about Makefiles.

## Issues Resolved
1. Makefile gave `recipe for target 'start' failed` error which the API checks beforehand.

## ToDo
1. Cleanup the code (cpruss.c) - Some commented code needs to be removed, also the main() function which helps in debugging.
2. Documentation for USING the API.
3. Add the load_firmware() and make() functions.

## Current Blockers
1. Understanding of Makefiles - Working on it

Some notes:
- PRU cannot be stopped (`echo stop | sudo tee state`) when its status is `offline`.
- PRU cannot be started (`echo start | sudo tee state`) when its status is `running`. Instead it must be stopped and started.
