Started by reading about software pwms. The terms used sounded somewhat confusing at first. [http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/Atmel-8020-Low-Jitter-Multi-Channel-Software-PWM_ApplicationNote_AVR136.pdf](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/Atmel-8020-Low-Jitter-Multi-Channel-Software-PWM_ApplicationNote_AVR136.pdf) This helped in understanding what had to be done. Most of the examples, however were in C instead of assembly. For easy calulation of frequency, I will be developing the example in assembly.

The Documentation and communication scheme was added in the example3. The stepper motor should arrive tomorrow according to FedEx. Till then I'm working on analog wave generation starting with sine wave. I don't know how to pass more than 512KB using RPMsg, supposedly the resource table has to be modified. Will update about this at the end of the day.
