The Documentation and communication scheme was added in the example3. The stepper motor should arrive tomorrow according to FedEx. Till then I'm working on analog wave generation starting with sine wave. I don't know how to pass more than 512KB using RPMsg, supposedly the resource table has to be modified. Will update about this at the end of the day.
