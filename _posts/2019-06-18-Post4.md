## Tuesday 19-06-2019
* Since I couldn't write the memory functions last week, I need to get it done now. The daemon does not contain these functions yet, so add these to it and make appropriate changes to cpp-bindings.
* Will be working in 'wip' branch and will submit pull requests from there to better track the changes. 
* Also add config_pin, generate resource table commands?

## Monday 18-06-2019
* Posted the ideas list to the mentors, will get the review tomorrow.
* Meanwhile, I worked on restructuring my C code to use the daemon, so that userspace apps don't need to deal with root permissions. This was a good excercise because C-library was generated and although it's not OOP, I got a better understanding of the required workflow.
* There are sill some errors in the C-code that need to be removed.<br>
