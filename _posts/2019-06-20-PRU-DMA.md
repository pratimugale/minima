## Aim: 
Instead of using /dev/mem, I was thinking of using a generalized driver as written in PRU-DMA project and then creating a sysfs interface to read/write from memory. Then I can add the memory functions to the python daemon service.<br>

-------
<br>
The first example I'm going to start with is the PWM example. The inputs can be written to the shared memory via the sysfs entries for the dma driver. Then the PRUs can read the shared memory and change the ouput accordingly.<br>

So I'll have to get the PRU DMA project up and running. This seems like a little difficult task for me as I've not understood how the project exactly works. I'll track all my progress regarding DMA here.<br>

* Clone the Project 
* `export PRU_CGT=/usr/share/ti/cgt-pru`
* `wget https://git.ti.com/pru-software-support-package/pru-software-support-package/archive-tarball/v5.1.0` - He gives this step
