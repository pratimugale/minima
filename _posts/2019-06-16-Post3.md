* Mentors asked me to work on ideas for examples that can be used with PRU and can be benefitted using the API :

This is what I have thought of:

1. Analog Wave Generation: To produce a custom Analog Wave. Can be expanded to read an Analog input and produce it as an approximated output using Pulse Width Modulation. Sine wave could be checked with speaker. Input can be written into data memory.
2. BBB to Arduino or two BBB serial connection via UART.
3. Bitbanging UART: I went through https://github.com/chanakya-vc/PRU-I2C_SPI_master/wiki and UART controller can also be added here.
4. I searched about the PID idea, referred to
https://beagleboardfoundation.wordpress.com/2016/12/31/motor-speed-control-using-beaglebone-pru/ and
https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-control-system-design-a-first-look. My concern is that will this involve too much hardware ?
5. PWM Generation and Servo Motor Control (Making a generic customizable platform).

* Meanwhile also worked on restructuring the C code to use Muneeb's Python Daemon Service so that they have the same base.

## Friday 14-06-2019
* Discussed with Mentors Abhishek Kumar and Zubeen Tolani on how to move forward with the project.
* Spent much time of the day learning the previous year's (Mohammed Muneeb's) code. I wasn't understanding the code before as I was spending to much time on the working of PRUs themselves. But it did prove useful as I began to learn the code very quickly - the Python Daemon Service part, SWIG integration, how OOP concepts can be used for the PRUs.
* Cloned Muneeb's repository, installed it and tested and played around with the code. Will be working on it's fork now: https://github.com/pratimugale/PRUSS-Bindings

## Thursday 13-06-2019
* Watched Debian Packaging Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFzPrzY2KFM&t=133s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFzPrzY2KFM&t=133s)
* Learn't how to use SWIG, created interface file, generated and tested the API functions for Python. (In /libraries/Python/pypruss.py)
* Documented process and expected errors while using SWIG with cpruss.c
* Mentor Zubeen Tolani reviewed the code and much more work needs to be done on improving the code. Will be working much harder now.

## Wednesday 12-06-2019
* Sent the email to linux-omap@vger.kernel.org 
* Completed and tested the RPMsg functions with lab_5 of TI
* Weekly meeting conducted today.
* Downloaded and Installed SWIG on the BBB. I have installed it in `/home/debian/work/swigtool`. The downloaded files are in `/home/debian/Downloads`. Installation made according to this site: [https://www.dev2qa.com/how-to-install-swig-on-macos-linux-and-windows/](https://www.dev2qa.com/how-to-install-swig-on-macos-linux-and-windows/). 

## Tuesday
* Again faced some problems with RPMsg, but figured it out and documented it.
* Started writing send_msg, get_msg functions.
* Again, couldn't get much done today.

## Monday 10-06-2019
* Couldn't get much done as I had some work that I had to get done.
