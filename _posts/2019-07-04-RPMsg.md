# RPMsg

RPMsg is quite tricky to get started with and takes a lot of time to learn as the Documentation is quite scattered. So I'll try to sum it all up in this post and try to explain everything I can.

remoteproc - A framework for controlling the lifecycle of secondary processors in an asymmetric multiprocessor system. Asymmetric multiprocessor system means NOT all of the processors are treated equally. So the system may allow only one CPU to handle operating system code and other for I/O operations. In the case of a BeagleBone Black, we have ARM Cortex which runs the OS and 2 real-time, deterministic PRUs performing I/O tasks. The ARM and the PRU subsystems are connected via the L3 interconnect. <br>
It takes the ARM around 40 cycles to access the shared memory over L3 interconnect.
The PRU does not support asynchronous interrupts. Asynchronous interrupts can introduce jitter in execution time and
generally reduce determinism. 

Remoteproc enables the use of the RPMsg framework for message sharing. A resource table is necessary for the ARM - PRU communication that RPMsg provides. Using remoteproc is as simple as probing the driver, copying the firmware, and then use the exposed sysfs entries to control execution.

Now, coming to RPMsg, it is a message passing mechanism that requests resources through remoteproc and builds on top of the virtio framework. Kernel documentation available in /Documentation/rpmsg.txt. It ties in with existing remoteproc driver framework and provides fairly simple interface for passing messages between User Space and the PRU firmware.
RPMsg exposes the virtual device (PRU) to the ARM User Space. User Space applications use the /dev/rpmsg_pruX to pass messages to and from the PRU. Shared buffers are requested through the resource_table and provided by the remoteproc module during PRU firmware loading (as shown in the remoteproc procedure above). The shared buffers are contained inside a vring data structure in DDR memory. There are two vrings provided per PRU core, one vring is used for messages passed to the ARM and the other vring is used for messages received from the ARM. System level mailboxes are used to notify cores (ARM or PRU) when new messages are waiting in the shared buffers.
