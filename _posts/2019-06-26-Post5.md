* Started a bit late today, will work till late.
* Read about programming the PRU in assembly which will be called by the C program. This is important as it will be easy to calculate the delays for PWM. Each instruction takes 5ns for the PRU to execute as the PRU is 200 MHz.
* I saw Zeekhuge's blinky example which uses asmand tried to run it. Initially it wouldn't compile and give out the error: `cannot open source file "pru_cfg.h"` So I had to modify his Makefile to give proper paths to the `LIBS` and `INCLUDE` variables. The paths for these varaibles can be found in my standard Makefile present in the blinky and pwm example in my repo. This Makefile was initially taken and modified from the PRU Cookbook. 
* For examples using assembly, we will need Zeekhuge's Makefile present in his blinky example. The variables will have to be modified as stated above. Other important paths are: 
PRU_CGT:=/usr/share/ti/cgt-pru
PRU_SUPPORT:=/usr/lib/ti/pru-software-support-package
These were the directories in which `cgt-pru` and `pru-software-support-package` came pre-installed in.
* The daemon-service in my repo is unable to be installed. Previously, it was working properly but now "goes into a failed state". Also looking into this error.
