1. Created the API in C and added control functions.
2. Tested and added the Blinky Program from PRU CookBook

Some notes:
- PRU cannot be stopped (`echo stop | sudo tee state`) when its status is `offline`.
- PRU cannot be started (`echo start | sudo tee state`) when its status is `running`. Insted it must be stopped and started.
