## Accomplishments
1. Created the API in C and added control functions.
2. Tested and added the Blinky Program from PRU CookBook
3. Tested the example for both PRUs


## Issues Resolved
1. Makefile gave `recipe for target 'start' failed` error which the API checks beforehand.

## ToDo
1. Cleanup the code (cpruss.c) - Some commented code needs to be removed, also the main() function which helps in debugging.

## Current Blockers
1. Understanding of Makefiles - Working on it

Some notes:
- PRU cannot be stopped (`echo stop | sudo tee state`) when its status is `offline`.
- PRU cannot be started (`echo start | sudo tee state`) when its status is `running`. Insted it must be stopped and started.
